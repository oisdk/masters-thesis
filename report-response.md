--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would first like to thank the examiners for their thorough
and helpful report.

In the updated version of the thesis, I have addressed all of the
points raised. In particular:

* In the introduction there is a new subsection enumerating the precise
  contributions of the thesis (page 7-8).
* All theorems and lemmas now cite the original proof (if there is one), or
  relevant work, or they say if the proof is novel.
* The related work section has been updated to better point out how the thesis
  differs from previous work.
* A conclusion has been added.
* The minor comments have been addressed also.

Thank you for your time,
Donnacha Oisín Kidney.
