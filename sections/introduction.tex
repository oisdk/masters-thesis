\chapter{Introduction}
Finiteness in classical mathematics is a simple, almost uninteresting subject.
There are many interesting finite things, mind you, and many of those things are
finite for interesting reasons; finiteness itself, though, is downright boring.

Part of the reason for the simplicity of finiteness is that there's really only
one notion of finiteness: we say that some set is finite if it has a cardinality
equal to some natural number.
If we want to \emph{prove} that something is finite we have at our disposal a
rich array of techniques and insights: we could show that it has a surjection
from another finite set, or that it's equivalent to another finite set.
We could show that any infinite list of its elements must contain duplicates
(this is called ``streamless''), or that there is a finite list which contains
all of its elements.
Once proven, though, all of that complexity collapses.

In constructive mathematics the story is a little different.
When we prove something constructively, often the thing proven retains
components of the proof itself.
Take the proposition \(P\) ``there is a prime number greater than 100''.
To prove it, we might take a number that's bigger than 100, say 127, and then
show that it's prime.
Classically, this proof would show that there is (at least one) prime number
bigger than 100.
Constructively, though, proofs themselves are mathematical objects, just like
numbers or functions.
As such, our proof of \(P\) actually \emph{contains} the number 127, and it proves
something formally different from a proof which used another number.
In fact, modulo some caveats we will explain soon, there is no way to provide a
proof of \(P\) which \emph{doesn't} reveal the particular prime number we had in
mind while proving.

This phenomenon is what makes finiteness in constructive mathematics so much
richer and more complex than classical finiteness.
Proving that something is ``streamless'' proves something fundamentally
different to showing a bijection with a finite set.
The other sense in which proofs in constructive mathematics are objects which
can be manipulated is that, when these proofs are written on a computer, they
often can be \emph{executed} as computer programs.
The program ``there is a prime number greater than 100'' isn't a terribly useful
one, but we will see some examples which are later on.

This thesis will explore and explain finiteness in constructive
mathematics: using this setting, it will also serve as an introduction to
constructive mathematics in Cubical Agda
\citep{vezzosiCubicalAgdaDependently2019}, and some related topics.

An exploration of finiteness also provides ample opportunity to explain much of
the fundamentals of Homotopy Type Theory \citep{hottbook}: this theory is a
foundational system for mathematics, which has at its core the \emph{univalence
  axiom}.
We will dive much more into this axiom later on, but for now know that it gives
a formal grounding to say ``if two types are isomorphic, it is possible to treat
them as the same.''
We could, for instance, have two different representations for the natural
numbers (binary and unary possibly): the univalence axiom allows us to say ``all
of the things we have proven about the unary numbers are also true about the
binary numbers''.
This is an essential technique in most areas of mathematics, which
had no formal basis in type theory until recently.

All of our work will be formalised in Agda
\citep{norellDependentlyTypedProgramming2008}, a
dependently typed, pure, functional programming language which can be
used as a proof assistant.
Proof assistants are computer programs which verify the correctness of formal
proofs.
Proofs in Agda are programs which can be run: its syntax is quite similar to
Haskell's.
A recent extension to Agda, Cubical Agda
\citep{vezzosiCubicalAgdaDependently2019}, allows Agda to compile and typecheck
programs written in Cubical Type Theory \citep{cohenCubicalTypeTheory2016}: this
type theory gives a \emph{computational} interpretation of the univalence axiom.
By ``computational interpretation'' here we mean that we will be able to run the
programs we write which rely on this axiom.

This thesis is aimed at individuals with some knowledge of Haskell (although
extensive knowledge of Haskell is not an absolute necessity) and a curiosity
about dependent types.
We will explain the basics of dependently-typed programming in Agda, how to
write programs and how to write proofs, and we will explain something of the
internals of dependent type theory along the way.
\section{Overview}
This thesis is structured as follows: in Chapter~\ref{agda-intro} we will
introduce Agda, its syntax, and quickly bring reader up to speed with how to
write programs in it.
We will also begin to talk about some more foundational type-theory concepts,
and we will explain a little about Agda's particular interpretation of HoTT and
CuTT.
As we mentioned, some programming experience in Haskell is useful, although not
strictly speaking necessary.
Certainly no knowledge of dependent type theory is required.

In Chapter~\ref{finiteness-predicates} we will look in-depth at the focus of
this thesis: finiteness.
As mentioned finiteness in constructive mathematics is a good deal more complex
than finiteness classically:
in this thesis along we will see five separate definitions of ``finiteness'',
each different, and each with reasonable claim to being the ``true'' definition
of finiteness.
We will see which predicates imply each other, what extra information we can
derive from the predicates, and what types are included or excluded from each.
Along the way we will learn a little more about HoTT and univalence, and we'll
see some practical and direct uses of the univalence axiom.

In Chapter~\ref{topos} we will look a little at a slightly more advanced
application of HoTT: topos theory.
A topos is quite a complex, abstract object: it behaves something like the
category of sets, although it is more general.
For us, showing that sets in Homotopy Type Theory form a topos (well, nearly)
will give us access to the general language of toposes.

In Chapter~\ref{search} we will combine everything from the previous chapters
into a (somewhat) practical program for proof search.
This program will automatically construct proofs of predicates over finite
domains.
We will demonstrate the program with the countdown problem
\citep{huttonCountdownProblem2002}: this is a somewhat famous puzzle where
players are given five numbers and a target, and have to construct an expression
using some or all of the supplied numbers which evaluates to the target.

Finally, in Chapter~\ref{infinite} we will see how we can adapt the work of
previous chapters to the setting of countably infinite types.
Countably infinite are those types that have a bijection with the natural
numbers: we will see that we can develop a similar framework of proofs for them
as we did for the finite types (with some important differences).
\section{Contributions}
Since much of this thesis is dedicated to exploring well-researched topics from
a new perspective, some of the contributions can be difficult to tease out.
There are three types of valuable and useful work provided in this thesis:
\begin{description}
  \item[Exposition of Already-Existing Work]
    Many explorations of dependent types in programming follow the well-trodden
    path of describing length-indexed vectors, explaining one or two aspects of
    totality, and perhaps building up to a proof that \(\mathit{reverse} \circ
    \mathit{reverse} \equiv \mathit{id}\).
    One of the aims of this thesis is to provide a different introduction to
    dependent types which also touches on some of the core aspects of HoTT, a
    topic missing much introductory material for functional programmers.
  \item[Formalised Proofs of Theorems proved Informally Elsewhere]
    ``Informal'' here means not machine checked.
    All theorems stated in this thesis are proved formally in Cubical Agda and
    machine-checked: the full code for these proofs is available
    online\footnote{\url{https://oisdk.github.io/masters-thesis/README.html}}.
    Formal proofs can be quite different from their informal counterparts, and
    it is usually not trivial to formalise a pen-and-paper proof.
    Furthermore, often in formalising a proof new insights about the proof are
    revealed.
  \item[New Fundamental Theoretical Contributions]
    Several of the constructions presented in this thesis are in fact novel, and
    some of the theorems proven have not been proven (either formally or
    informally) elsewhere.
\end{description}


\section{What is a Proof?}
Constructive mathematics is, fundamentally, a different way of thinking about
proofs.
Classically we have two different universes of things: we have
objects, like the natural numbers, or the rings; and the proofs on those things.
Constructive mathematics joins those two worlds together.

Practically speaking this means that in constructive mathematics we can't
always ``prove the existence of'' some thing; instead we simply provide that
thing.
We mentioned an example where this comes into play: to prove that something is
finite we might want to prove that it is in bijection with some other finite
type.
Constructively, this proof \emph{is} a bijection.

Constructive mathematics is also deeply tied to computers.
Dependently-typed programming languages, like Agda
\citep{norellDependentlyTypedProgramming2008}, Coq
\citep{thecoqdevelopmentteamCoqProofAssistant2020}, or Idris
\citep{bradyIdrisGeneralpurposeDependently2013}, allow us to compile and
\emph{run} our proofs.
If we provide a bijection between two types in Agda we also provide a function
to and from each type.
Agda is therefore both a formal language for constructive proofs and a
programming language which can run those proofs.

This relation between proofs and programs is often called the Curry-Howard
correspondence.
Under this framework, propositions in the logical sense correspond to types in
the programming sense \citep{wadlerPropositionsTypes2015}; proofs of those
propositions then correspond to programs which inhabit those types.
As an example we have from propositional logic the following:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{A \wedge B}{A}
\end{equation*}
This is conjunction elimination: if we know \(A\) and \(B\), we also know \(A\).

Via Curry-Howard, the type corresponding to conjunction is in fact the pair (or
tuple).
\(A\) and \(B\) are also types.
So, the above proposition, as a type, is the following:
\begin{agdalisting*}
  \ExecuteMetaData[haskell/Pair.tex]{fst-ty} \vspace{-\baselineskip}
\end{agdalisting*}
And the proof which inhabits this type?
It is the function often called \verb+fst+: the selector for the first component
of the pair.
\begin{agdalisting*}
  \ExecuteMetaData[haskell/Pair.tex]{fst} \vspace{-\baselineskip}
\end{agdalisting*}

Occasionally we don't want to provide the extra information that
constructiveness demands: it is occasionally useful to say ``there exists some
\(x\) which satisfies some predicate \(P\)'' without revealing the value of \(x\).
In other words, we want to retrieve something of the classical notion of an
existential in a constructive setting.
Later, for instance, we will begin to work with the
category of finite sets.
The objects of this category are (of course) finite sets: however, if our notion
of ``finite'' is tied to an explicit bijection, that means that the type of
``things which are finite'' is pairs of types and bijections between those
types. 
Since there are \(n!\) bijections between a type of cardinality \(n\) and any
other, this means that for every such type we have \(n!\) different objects,
instead of just 1.
We'll see a way to fix this problem with Homotopy Type Theory.

The proofs we will provide in this thesis will be written in the syntax of
Agda: they are, however, all valid classical proofs.
Constructive mathematics is a subset of classical, after all.
When we say ``constructive'' we really just mean that these proofs avoid
reliance on certain axioms like the law of the excluded middle, or the axiom of
choice.
\section{Homotopy Type Theory}
While this thesis can serve as an introduction to proofs in dependent type
theory generally, it can also serve as an introduction to Homotopy Type Theory
\citep{hottbook}.
HoTT is a type theory and foundational theory for mathematics: it is designed to
stand in for ZFC in mathematical terms, and things like Martin-Löf type theory
computer science terms.

Central to the theory is the univalence axiom.
This axiom states that isomorphism implies equality: more precisely, that
``equivalence'' is equivalent to equality.
We haven't defined equivalence yet (and we haven't defined equality rigorously
yet), but the core thrust of the axiom is that it gives proofs of isomorphism
all the power of proofs of equality.

From a proof perspective, this is quite useful for transporting proofs from one
domain to another: for instance, a proof that some type \(A\) is finite can be
transported to a proof that any type isomorphic to \(A\) is finite.
From a programming perspective, this is quite useful for transporting
\emph{programs}: an API defined on some type can suddenly be reused, without
change, on another type as long as the latter is isomorphic to the former.
It's worth noting that the technique mentioned here is used quite
pervasively in everyday mathematics: it's just that foundational systems could
not justify its use.

The other addition that HoTT gives to traditional type theory is that of Higher
Inductive Types.
Traditional inductive types are defined by listing their constructors: with HITs
we can also list the equalities they must satisfy.
The most obvious immediate use of this is quotient types: another concept which
is regarded as standard in normal mathematics, but somewhat embarrassingly
missing from most constructive theories.
In truth, the fact that HITs can be used to describe simple set quotients is
almost incidental: in HoTT they are a far more powerful, general tool,
which can be used to define a wide variety of essential constructions like the
circle, torus, etc.
This thesis isn't very interested in these homotopy-focused topics, however it
is worth mentioning as it is one of HoTT's great strengths.

Finally, we have to explain where Cubical Type Theory
\citep{cohenCubicalTypeTheory2016} fits in.
Strictly speaking in this thesis we will not work directly in HoTT: we work
instead in CuTT, which is very closely related, but not quite the same, as HoTT.
CuTT introduces the interval type for its paths, whereas in HoTT (and Martin-Löf
type theory, which we will describe later) paths are an inductive type.
This different ``implementation'' of paths is central to how CuTT can give
computational content to univalence, but it also slightly changes the way paths
function.

There is one crucial difference between the two theories: in CuTT the
univalence ``axiom'' is in fact a theorem, with computational content.
This means that univalence is not a built-in, assumed to be true, but instead
it's actually derived from other axioms in the system.
Practically speaking it means that univalence has computational content: i.e. if
we see that two types are equal then we can actually derive the isomorphism that
that equality implies.
As we're using CuTT as a programming language (in the form of Cubical Agda
\citep{vezzosiCubicalAgdaDependently2019}), this is an essential feature.
It means that the proofs we write using univalence still correspond to programs
which can be run.

\footnotetext{
  To be absolutely correct we should not say that CuTT implements HoTT, as the
  two have some subtle differences.
  While everything we can prove in HoTT can also be proven in CuTT
  It is not the case that one is a strict subset of the other.
  CuTT has many of the same features of HoTT, like HITs and univalence, so
  almost all of the theory of HoTT applies to both (and indeed almost all of the
  univalent foundations program applies to both), but there are some slight
  differences between the theories which mean that some proofs which are valid
  HoTT are not valid in CuTT.
