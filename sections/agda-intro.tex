\chapter{Programming and Proving in Cubical Agda}

Agda \cite{stumpVerifiedFunctionalProgramming2016} is a dependently-typed
functional programming language.
A recent extension to the language, Cubical Agda
\cite{vezzosiCubicalAgdaDependently2019}, allows us to do Cubical Type Theory
directly in Agda.

In this chapter we will go through a basic example to explain the fundamentals
of programming in Agda, and we will begin to explain some cubical type theory
features.
\section{Basic Agda}
The basic unit of functionality in Agda is the \emph{type}.
We can define types like so:
\begin{agdalisting}
  \ExecuteMetaData[agda/Snippets/Bool.tex]{bool-def}
\end{agdalisting}
