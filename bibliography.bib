Central to our development are the notions of containers and container functors. These provide a new conceptual analysis of data structures and polymorphic functions by exploiting dependent type theory as a convenient way to define constructions in Martin-L\"of categories. We also show that morphisms between containers can be full and faithfully interpreted as polymorphic functions (i.e.natural transformations) and that, in the presence of W-types, all strictly positive types (including nested inductive and coinductive types) give rise to containers.},

  abstract = {`Categorification' is the process of replacing equations by isomorphisms. We describe some of the ways a thoroughgoing emphasis on categorification can simplify and unify mathematics. We begin with elementary arithmetic, where the category of finite sets serves as a categorified version of the set of natural numbers, with disjoint union and Cartesian product playing the role of addition and multiplication. We sketch how categorifying the integers leads naturally to the infinite loop space Omega\^infinity S\^infinity, and how categorifying the positive rationals leads naturally to a notion of the `homotopy cardinality' of a tame space. Then we show how categorifying formal power series leads to Joyal's `especes des structures', or `structure types'. We also describe a useful generalization of structure types called `stuff types'. There is an inner product of stuff types that makes the category of stuff types into a categorified version of the Hilbert space of the quantized harmonic oscillator. We conclude by sketching how this idea gives a nice explanation of the combinatorics of Feynman diagrams.},

The definition generalises easily to arbitrary unary containers, including types with infinite values, such as streams. By using a slight variation of the definition one gets set equivalence instead, i.e. equality up to order and multiplicity. Other variations give the subset and subbag preorders.

The Cantor space of infinite sequences of binary digits is known to be searchable. Searchable sets are exhaustible, and we show that the converse also holds for sets of hereditarily total elements in the hierarchy of continuous functionals; moreover, a selection functional can be constructed uniformly from a quantification functional. We prove that searchable sets are closed under intersections with decidable sets, and under the formation of computable images and of finite and countably infinite products. This is related to the fact, established here, that exhaustible sets are topologically compact. We obtain a complete description of exhaustible total sets by developing a computational version of a topological Arzela--Ascoli type characterization of compact subsets of function spaces. We also show that, in the non-empty case, they are precisely the computable images of the Cantor space. The emphasis of this paper is on the theory of exhaustible and searchable sets, but we also briefly sketch applications.},

A first example of an omniscient set is the one-point compactification of the natural numbers, also known as the generic convergent sequence. We relate this to Grilliot's and Ishihara's Tricks. We generalize this example to many infinite subsets of the Cantor space. These subsets turn out to be ordinals in a constructive sense, with respect to the lexicographic order, satisfying both a well-foundedness condition with respect to decidable subsets, and transfinite induction restricted to decidable predicates. The use of simple types allows us to reach any ordinal below {$\epsilon$}Q, and richer type systems allow us to get higher.},

To work with such structures in proof assistants, we need to be able to explain what a finite set is. In constructive mathematics, a widely used definition is listability: a set is considered to be finite, if its elements can be listed completely. In this paper, we formalize different variations of this definition in the Agda programming language. We develop a toolbox for boilerplate-free programming with finite sets that arise as subsets of some base set with decidable equality. Among other things we implement combinators for defining functions from finite sets and a prover for quantified formulas over decidable properties on finite sets.},

It applies to structures that are decomposable, i.e., formally specifiable by grammars involving set, sequence, and cycle constructions. A general strategy is developed for solving the random generation problem with two closely related types of methods: for structures of size n, the boustrophedonic algorithms exhibit a worst-case behaviour of the form O(n log n); the sequential algorithms have worst case O(n2), while offering good potential for optimizations in the average case. The complexity model is in terms of arithmetic operations and both methods appeal to precomputed numerical table of linear size that can be computed in time O(n2).A companion calculus permits systematically to compute the average case cost of the sequential generation algorithm associated to a given specification. Using optimizations dictated by the cost calculus, several random generation algorithms of the sequential type are developed; most of them have expected complexity 1/2n log n, and are thus only slightly superlinear. The approach is exemplified by the random generation of a number of classical combinatorial structures including Cayley trees, hierarchies, the cycle decomposition of permutations, binary trees, functional graphs, surjections, and set partitions.},

We use higher inductive types to define the type K(A) of "finite sets over type A" \`a la Kuratowski without assuming that K(A) has decidable equality. We show how to define basic functions and prove basic properties after which we give two applications of our definition.  On the foundational side, we use K to define the notions of "Kuratowski-finite type" and "Kuratowski-finite subobject", which we contrast with established notions, e.g. Bishop-finite types and enumerated types. We argue that Kuratowski-finiteness is the most general and flexible one of those and we define the usual operations on finite types and subobjects.  From the computational perspective, we show how to use K(A) for an abstract interface for well-known finite set implementations such as tree- and list-like data structures. This implies that a function defined on a concrete finite sets implementation can be obtained from a function defined on the abstract finite sets K(A) and that correctness properties are inherited. Hence, HoTT is the ideal setting for data refinement. Beside this, we define bounded quantification, which lifts a decidable property on A to one on K(A).},

  abstract = {In type theory a proposition is represented by a type, the type of its proofs. As a consequence, the equality relation on a certain type is represented by a binary family of types. Equality on a type may be conventional or inductive. Conventional equality means that one particular equivalence relation is singled out as the equality, while inductive equality \textendash{} which we also call identity \textendash{} is inductively defined as the `smallest reflexive relation'. It is sometimes convenient to know that the type representing a proposition is collapsed, in the sense that all its inhabitants are identical. Although uniqueness of identity proofs for an arbitrary type is not derivable inside type theory, there is a large class of types for which it may be proved. Our main result is a proof that any type with decidable identity has unique identity proofs. This result is convenient for proving that the class of types with decidable identities is closed under indexed sum. Our proof of the main result is completely formalized within a kernel fragment of Martin-Lo\textasciidieresis f's type theory and mechanized using ALF. Proofs of auxiliary lemmas are explained in terms of the category theoretical properties of identity. These suggest two coherence theorems as the result of rephrasing the main result in a context of conventional equality, where the inductive equality has been replaced by, in the former, an initial category structure and, in the latter, a smallest reflexive relation.},

It is however quite challenging to formalize, for a variety of reasons. Agda currently (i.e. in 2020) does not have a standard, working formalization of category theory. We document our work on solving this dilemma. The formalization revealed a number of potential design choices, and we present, motivate and explain the ones we picked. In particular, we find that alternative definitions or alternative proofs from those found in standard textbooks can be advantageous, as well as "fit" Agda's type theory more smoothly. Some definitions regarded as equivalent in standard textbooks turn out to make different "universe level" assumptions, with some being more polymorphic than others. We also pay close attention to engineering issues, in particular so that the library integrates well with Agda's own standard library, as well as supporting as many of the modes of Agda as possible.},

This poses a severe limitation on both what is provable and the re-usability of proofs. Recent developments have, however, resulted in cubical type theory, which permits a constructive proof of univalence. The programming language Agda has been extended with capabilities for working in such a cubical setting. This thesis will explore the usefulness of this extension in the context of category theory. The thesis will motivate the need for univalence and explain why propositional equality in cubical Agda is more expressive than in standard Agda. Alternative approaches to Cubical Agda will be presented and their pros and cons will be explained. As an example of the application of univalence, two formulations of monads will be presented: Namely monads in the monoidal form and monads in the Kleisli form. Using univalence, it will be shown how these are equal. Finally the thesis will explain the challenges that a developer will face when working with cubical Agda and give some techniques to overcome these difficulties. It will suggest how further work can help alleviate some of these challenges.},

This involves an infinite tower of coherence conditions, and we therefore need the category to have Reedy limits of diagrams over omega. Our main result is that, if the category further has propositional truncations and satisfies function extensionality, the type of constant function is equivalent to the type ||A|| -{$>$} B. If B is an n-type for a given finite n, the tower of coherence conditions becomes finite and the requirement of nontrivial Reedy limits vanishes. The whole construction can then be carried out in Homotopy Type Theory and generalises the universal property of the truncation. This provides a way to define functions ||A|| -{$>$} B if B is not known to be propositional, and it streamlines the common approach of finding a proposition Q with A -{$>$} Q and Q -{$>$} B.},

A key ingredient in these constructions are weakly constant endofunctions on identity types. We study such endofunctions on arbitrary types and show that they always factor through a propositional type, the truncated or squashed domain. Such a factorization is impossible for weakly constant functions in general (a result by Shulman), but we present several non-trivial cases in which it can be done. Based on these results, we define a new notion of anonymous existence in type theory and compare different forms of existence carefully. In addition, we show possibly surprising consequences of the judgmental computation rule of the truncation, in particular in the context of homotopy type theory.

We retrace our steps in this article, introducing the applicative pattern by diverse examples, then abstracting it to define the Applicative type class and introducing a bracket notation that interprets the normal application syntax in the idiom of an Applicative functor. Furthermore, we develop the properties of applicative functors and the generic operations they support. We close by identifying the categorical structure of applicative functors and examining their relationship both with Monads and with Arrow.},

This has led to elegant computer formalizations of multiple classical results from homotopy theory. However, many proofs are still surprisingly complicated to formalize. One reason for this is the axiomatic treatment of univalence and higher inductive types which complicates synthetic reasoning as many intermediate steps, that could hold simply by computation, require explicit arguments. Cubical type theory offers a solution to this in the form of a new type theory with native support for both univalence and higher inductive types. In this paper we show how the recent cubical extension of Agda can be used to formalize some of the major results of homotopy type theory in a direct and elegant manner.},

  abstract = {Homotopy Type Theory may be seen as an internal language for the {$\infty$}-category of weak {$\infty$}-groupoids. Moreover, weak {$\infty$}-groupoids model the univalence axiom. Voevodsky proposes this (language for) weak {$\infty$}groupoids as a new foundation for mathematics called the univalent foundations. It includes the sets as weak {$\infty$}-groupoids with contractible connected components, and thereby it includes (much of) the traditional set theoretical foundations as a special case. We thus wonder whether those `discrete' groupoids do in fact form a (predicative) topos. More generally, homotopy type theory is conjectured to be the internal language of `elementary' of {$\infty$}-toposes. We prove that sets in homotopy type theory form a {$\Pi$}W-pretopos. This is similar to the fact that the 0-truncation of an {$\infty$}topos is a topos. We show that both a subobject classifier and a 0-object classifier are available for the type theoretical universe of sets. However, both of these are large and moreover the 0-object classifier for sets is a function between 1-types (i.e. groupoids) rather than between sets. Assuming an impredicative propositional resizing rule we may render the subobject classifier small and then we actually obtain a topos of sets.},

Johnstone's topological topos was created to present the geometric realization of simplicial sets as a geometric morphism between toposes. Johnstone shows that simplicial sets classify strict linear orders with disjoint endpoints and that (classically) the unit interval is such an order. Here we show that it can also be a target for cubical realization by showing that Coquand's cubical sets classify the geometric theory of flat distributive lattices. As a side result, we obtain a simplicial realization of a cubical set. 2. Using the internal `interval' in the topos of cubical sets, we construct a Moore path model of identity types. 3. We construct a premodel structure internally in the cubical type theory and hence on the fibrant objects in cubical sets.},

  abstract = {Agda is an advanced programming language based on Type Theory. Agda's type system is expressive enough to support full functional verification of programs, in two styles. In external verification, we write pure functional programs and then write proofs of properties about them. The proofs are separate external artifacts, typically using structural induction. In internal verification, we specify properties of programs through rich types for the programs themselves. This often necessitates including proofs inside code, to show the type checker that the specified properties hold. The power to prove properties of programs in these two styles is a profound addition to the practice of programming, giving programmers the power to guarantee the absence of bugs, and thus improve the quality of software more than previously possible. Verified Functional Programming in Agda is the first book to provide a systematic exposition of external and internal verification in Agda, suitable for undergraduate students of Computer Science. No familiarity with functional programming or computer-checked proofs is presupposed.  The book begins with an introduction to functional programming through familiar examples like booleans, natural numbers, and lists, and techniques for external verification. Internal verification is considered through the examples of vectors, binary search trees, and Braun trees. More advanced material on type-level computation, explicit reasoning about termination, and normalization by evaluation is also included. The book also includes a medium-sized case study on Huffman encoding and decoding.},

  abstract = {Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical applications include the certification of properties of programming languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification project, or the Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the formalization of mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem or homotopy type theory) and teaching. The main changes brought by Coq version 8.11 are: Ltac2, a new tactic language for writing more robust larger scale tactics, with built-in support for datatypes and the multi-goal tactic monad. Primitive floats are integrated in terms and follow the binary64 format of the IEEE 754 standard, as specified in the Coq.Float.Floats library. Cleanups of the section mechanism, delayed proofs and further restrictions of template polymorphism to fix soundness issues related to universes. New unsafe flags to disable locally guard, positivity and universe checking. Reliance on these flags is always printed by Print Assumptions. Fixed bugs of Export and Import that can have a significant impact on user developments (common source of incompatibility!). New interactive development method based on vos interface files, allowing to work on a file without recompiling the proof parts of their dependencies. New Arguments annotation for bidirectional type inference configuration for reference (e.g. constants, inductive) applications. New refine attribute for Instance can be used instead of the removed Refine Instance Mode. Generalization of the under and over tactics of SSReflect to arbitrary relations. Revision of the Coq.Reals library, its axiomatisation and instances of the constructive and classical real numbers. Additionally, while the omega tactic is not yet deprecated in this version of Coq, it should soon be the case and we already recommend users to switch to lia in new proof scripts (see also the warning message in the corresponding chapter). The dev/doc/critical-bugs file documents the known critical bugs of Coq and affected releases. See the Changes in 8.11+beta1 section and following sections for the detailed list of changes, including potentially breaking changes marked with Changed.

  abstract = {Inspired by Joyals theory of species, we show how to add new type constructors and constructor combinators to the tool set of functional languages. We show that all the important properties of inductive types lift to this new setting. Species are analytic functors, representing a broader range of structures than regular functors. This includes structures such as bags, cycles and graphs. The theory is greatly inspired by combinatorics rather than type theory: this adds interesting new tools to bear, but also requires more work on our part to show that species form a good foundations for a theory of type constructors. The combinatorial tools provide a calculus for these structures which has strong links with classical analysis, via a functorial interpretation of generating series. Furthermore, we show how generic programming idioms also generalise to this richer setting. Once the theory is understood, various methods of implementation are relatively straightforward.},

  abstract = {Rational sequences are possibly infinite sequences with a finite number of distinct suffixes. In this paper, we present different implementations of rational sequences in Martin\textendash L\"of type theory. First, we literally translate the above definition of rational sequence into the language of type theory, i.e., we construct predicates on possibly infinite sequences expressing the finiteness of the set of suffixes. In type theory, there exist several inequivalent notions of finiteness. We consider two of them, listability and Noetherianness, and show that in the implementation of rational sequences the two notions are interchangeable. Then we introduce the type of lists with backpointers, which is an inductive implementation of rational sequences. Lists with backpointers can be unwound into rational sequences, and rational sequences can be truncated into lists with backpointers. As an example, we see how to convert the fractional representation of a rational number into its decimal representation and vice versa.},

  abstract = {Proof assistants based on dependent type theory provide expressive languages for both programming and proving within the same system. However, all of the major implementations lack powerful extensionality principles for reasoning about equality, such as function and propositional extensionality. These principles are typically added axiomatically which disrupts the constructive properties of these systems. Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types. This paper describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of higher inductive types. These new primitives make function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types directly definable with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types. This extends Agda with support for a wide range of extensionality principles, without sacrificing type checking and constructivity.},
